# gptengineer.app

Goal: create the best experience for rapid prototyping of web apps

Feedback in terms of bug reports and feature requests is super helpful in this. By reacting to tickets that matter most to you, you help us prioritize.

This is an issues repo for **[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)**. Are you looking for source code? gptengineer.app is built on and contributes back to the open source project [**gpt-engineer**](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer). The source code of the UI is not publicly available as of today.

## What

[**gptengineer.app**](https://gptengineer.app) enables anyone to create and customize interactive websites with plain english. Flow:

- Say what you want to build
- Let the AI build it and inspect the result
- Iteratively ask for edits/improvements
- One-click deploy

On top of this flow, all code is managed by git, so that us human devs can take over and implement requests where the AI system currently falls short.

## Why
Our mission is to unlock human creativity by reducing the barriers to build

## How do [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) and [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app) relate?

The team behind gptengineer.app sprung out of the open source code generation community. We are committed to giving back to it.

Specifically, the mission

> **Maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.

of [**gpt-engineer**](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) inspires us.

Part of the revenue from gptengineer.app will be funding a full time role as well as infrastructure, focused on building and maintaining open source tools for builders in the codegen community.

The GitHub organization gpt-engineer-org is created by the original gpt-engineer creator Anton Osika, where gpt-engineer community related projects are collected.

The open source project gpt-engineer is governed by a board that consists of its code contributors and is by default separate from gptengineer.app.

## What's next

We are soon:
- Making it easier to edit text and upload images WYSIWYG-style
- Adding full stack capabilities
    - (database read/write, auth, LLM APIs... We will prioritise according to feature requests in this repo)
- Announcing the team and company behind the product gptengineer.app
