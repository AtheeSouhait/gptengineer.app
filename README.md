# gptengineer.app

This is an issues repo for: **[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)**

Our goal is to create the best experience for rapid prototyping of web apps. Feedback in terms of bug reports and feature requests is super helpful in this. By reacting to tickets that matter most to you, you help us prioritize.

Are you looking for source code? gptengineer.app is built on and contributes back to the open source project [**gpt-engineer**](URL). The source code of the UI is not publicly available as of 2023.

## What

[**gptengineer.app**](https://gptengineer.app) enables anyone to create arbitrarily customizable websites with plain english like so:

- Say what you want to build
- Let the AI build it and inspect the result
- Iteratively ask for edits/improvements
- One-click deploy

On top of this flow, all code is managed by git, which means us human devs can take over and implement requests where the AI system falls short.

## Why
Our mission is to unlock human creativity.

Approach: Reduce the barriers to build

## How do [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) and [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app) relate?

The team behind gptengineer.app sprung out of the open source code generation community. We are committed to giving back to it.

Specifically, the mission

> **Maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.

of [**gpt-engineer**](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) inspires us.

Part of the revenue from gptengineer.app will be funding a full time role as well as infrastructure, focused on building and maintaining open source tools for builders in the codegen community.

The GitHub organization gpt-engineer-org is created by the original gpt-engineer creator Anton Osika, where gpt-engineer community related projects are collected.

The open source project gpt-engineer is governed by a board that consists of its code contributors and is by default separate from gptengineer.app.
